Some extensions require enabling browser sync or even imports:

- Tampermonkey: 'Settings > Userscript Sync' only downloads enabled Userscripts (missing disabled ones and general settings) -> instead import everything from another machine via 'Utilities > Cloud (Google Drive)'.
- uBlock Origin: 'Enable cloud storage support' in Settings, but afterwards still need to trigger import for 'Filter lists', 'My filters', 'My rules', 'Trusted sites'.
